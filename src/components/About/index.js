                represents a culmination of hardwork and sleepless nights over the couse of many months. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This journey started as early as my first ear of ollege. I always wanted to be able to create and do something that helps people. So I enrolled into the University of Texas at San Antonio as a Comp Science Major. <br/>
                Only to later switch to psychology having thought that becoming a therapist was something I would instead want to do to fulfill these goals of helping people. I graduate with a bachelors in psychology and went on to graduate school <br/>
                were I studied to get a master in clinical mental health counseling. The further I got into it the more I thought about what could have been if I stuck with the computer science route. So eventually I decided to take a leap which lead <br/>
                me to enroll in a software-developer boot-camp at the University of Texas at Austin. Were I am currently studing to fulfill a dream to create, inspire, and help people around the world!
